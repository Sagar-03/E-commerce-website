# MERN Ecommerce

## Description

A full-featured ecommerce store built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with integrations of third-party APIs. This platform facilitates three distinct user flows:

1. **Buyers:** Browse and shop products across various categories, brands, and collections.
2. **Sellers or Merchants:** Manage their own brand and product listings.
3. **Admins:** Oversee and control the entire platform, including users, orders, and products.

### Features:

- **Backend:** Powered by Node.js and Express.js for robust and scalable APIs.
- **Database:** MongoDB with Mongoose for seamless schema modeling and database management.
- **Frontend:** Developed using React for a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- **State Management:** Redux with Redux Thunk for efficient application state handling and asynchronous actions.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** JWT for secure user sessions.
